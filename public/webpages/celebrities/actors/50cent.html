            <h2 class="article-section-title" id="earlylife">Early Life, Music Career, Acting Job</h2>
            <p>Jackson III was born on July 9, 1976, a local of Queens, New York. He grew up in the neighborhood of South Jamaica, a neighborhood notable for high crime rates and gang violence. His mother was an infamous drug dealer in the area, but, unfortunately, died when Jackson III was 8. By 12, Jackson III was dealing drugs such as cocaine. By 19, he was the neighborhood's kingpin. Jackson III spent most of his time in jail, having been arrested for dealing drugs and carrying a gun.</p>
            <p>After being released from jail and having his first son, Jackson III started his now-iconic career in rap, a genre he was a devoted fan of considering he came from a place where many rappers have originated from. He recorded an initial debut album that went unreleased. In 2000, he was shot nine times, but managed to survive. He then went into hiding, and eventually, released his debut album, <i>Get Rich or Die Tryin'</i>. The lead single, "In Da Club", was a massive hit, staying atop Billboard Hot 100 for nine weeks. Soon, it became one of the highest-selling rap albums of all time.</p>
