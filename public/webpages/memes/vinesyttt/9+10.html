            <p> "9 + 10" is a famous video that circulated on the video-sharing platform Vine. It is often said and referenced in order to trick people, by asking "What's 9 + 10?". More often that not, the person asked will respond with "19", which leads the person who asked to "correct" them. </p>
            
            <h2 class="article-section-title" id="summary">Context/Synopsis</h2>
            <p>On June 22, 2013, Vine user @DREHUPEMSU @WESTROSECRAN uploaded the video to Vine. The video featured a boy being talked to by a man off-screen. </p>
            <p>In the video, the man claims that the boy is stupid. The boy denies this, so, the man asks him, "What's 9 + 10?". The boy answers 21, which leads the man to reaffirm his earlier statement. The kid's identity is unknown and is simply referred to as the "21 Kid".</p>
            <p>While the original Vine ended up being deleted, YouTuber Energy Clips! (@ShadowsShots) was able to reupload it to YouTube. As of now, it currently has 10,814,203 views and 110,000 likes. Comments on the video have been turned off. </p>

            <h2 class="article-section-title" id="spread">Spread</h2>
            <p>The video quickly became popular, and several took the video and remixed it. Vine user BRUH posted a remix that garnered 7.14 million loops (views in Vine context), 185,000 likes, and 145,000 revines (reposts).</p>
            <p>On October 13, the website Huzlers published an article, claiming the 21 Kid ran away and left a goodbye note. The article "revealed" that the child's real name was Habeeb Cisse had ran away from home on Saturday night. His goodbye note reads this:</p>

            <p>"I'm tired of everyone lafing at me, I am running away forever now, if yu want to find me the only clue I leaving is 21"</p>

            <p>While a good handful had fallen for the hoax, a YouTube video posted by user Franklin Clinton in 2016 disproved the claims (as the video was originally uploaded on DREHUPEMSU's Vine account).</p>
            <p>The meme saw a resurgence in 2019.</p>

            <h2 class="article-section-title" id="usage">Usage</h2>

            <p>The meme is often used to trick others and test their knowledge of the meme. Like in the video, someone will ask another what 9 + 10 equals. If they answer 21, it shows that the person asked is aware of the meme. More often than not, the person asked will reply with 19, which leads to the questioner to "correct" their answer (often with no explanation).
