Outline:

Home:
- Welcome!
- Introduction (description featured above)
- Directory

	For the Home page of our website, it will include a welcome greeting to users. Underneath the welcome greeting, the page will have an introduction to the website and its goals. This is based on the description above. At the bottom of the page is a directory to the rest of the main webpages of the website. These are News, Icons & Celebrities, Memes & Trends, Rise of the Internet, and About Us. For the navigation system, there will be a side bar that pops up upon clicking the hamburger menu button.

News:
- Latest
- Music
- Film & Television
- World
- Opinion & Story

	For the News page of our website, it will contain multiple divisions. These divisions are based on the general topics/subjects that the website covers. The first division, “Latest”, contains the newest entries in the website, regardless of genre. By the end of the day, all entries will be moved to their respective genre division, and the next day’s entries replace them. The second division will focus on news regarding music, such as latest releases and reviews. The third division focuses on news regarding film & television, including new shows, announcements, and actors. The fourth division focuses on global news, such as disasters, laws, and other topics not included in the previous two topics. The last division focuses on opinionated, anecdotal write-ups from the staff.

Icons & Celebrities:
- Actors
- Singers
- Politicians
- YouTubers/TikTokers

	Similar to the previous page, Icons & Celebrities will have multiple divisions. Actors include notable actors and actresses who have risen to fame. Singers include notable singers who have made huge impacts in pop culture and the world. Politicians include famous politicians who have made global news and are famous globally at some point. Influencer is reserved for personalities who have made their fame via social media. These will be further divided into YouTubers, TikTokers, and Others (for personalities who have achieved recognition mainly via other platforms). In the main page of Icons & Celebrities, entries will be arranged alphabetically, with dropdown menus for each letter, for ease of access. A search bar will also be available in each division so users can search for their desired personality quickly within each section. Each of the entries in Icons & Celebrities would have biographies, achievements, and anything in particular that made them popular.


Memes & Trends:
- Vines/YouTube/TikTok
- Stan Twitter/Floptok
- Brainrot
- Challenges/Trends

	Memes & Trends contains multiple divisions too. Vines/YouTube/TikTok refer to popular posts made on any of the three platforms. Stan Twitter/Floptok is a category for slang and memes that have originated from posts off Stan Twitter (Twitter community that consists of fan accounts of celebrities) and/or Floptok (TikTok community that consists of users who experience popularity due to memes/posts after an “era” of “flopping”, or a period where engagement to their posts and accounts was low). Brainrot consists of slang and memes that often originate from Gen Alpha. Challenges/Trends consist of activities/styles that multiple people follow, often becoming popular due to them.  In the main page of Memes & Trends, entries will be arranged alphabetically, with dropdown menus for each letter, for ease of access. A search bar will also be available in each division so users can search for their desired meme/trend quickly within each section. All entries under Memes & Trends will have image/video attachments of the original poster, some examples, and definitions and origins.

Rise of the Internet:
- Internet
- Social Media apps
  - Vine
  - musical.ly/TikTok
  - YouTube
  - Twitter/X
  - Facebook
  - Instagram
  - Reddit
  - Tumblr


	Rise of the Internet will also contain multiple divisions. The first division will focus on the history of the Internet as a whole: how it came to be, the people behind it, evolution of the Internet, and current state of the Internet. The rest of the divisions involve social media applications that have become famous. They will follow a similar structure: history, developers, evolution, and current state.

About Us:
- Developers

	About Us is a page dedicated to the developers of the website. It lists basic information, such as name, age, and current school. This is for any visitor to identify the website’s makers.

JS Incorporation: 

JavaScript will be incorporated into PopArchives to improve its interactivity and navigation in general. It will be used for our features such as a responsive navigation bar, smooth scrolling, and clickable sections of the Memes & Challenges section and Celebrities section. These features will significantly improve and even enhance the overall look and feel of the website to make it more modern and engaging for the users that will explore the pop side of the internet.
